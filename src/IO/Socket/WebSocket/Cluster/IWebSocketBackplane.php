/**
 * IWebSocketBackplane interface.
 *
 * The pluggable transport that carries {@see TWebSocketEnvelope} traffic between cluster nodes and
 * keeps the shared presence and node registries.  A {@see TWebSocketCluster} coordinator owns one
 * backplane and drives it; the backplane is the only part that knows the medium, so a Redis
 * pub/sub driver and a WebSocket peer-mesh driver are interchangeable behind this contract.
 *
 * Loop integration: {@see getSources()} returns any selectable resources to fold into the server's
 * event loop, and {@see tick()} is pumped once per loop iteration to read inbound traffic and run
 * housekeeping (heartbeats, registry expiry).  A driver that has no selectable resource returns an
 * empty array and does its work in {@see tick()}.
